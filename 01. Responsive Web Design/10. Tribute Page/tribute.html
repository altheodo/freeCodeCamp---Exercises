                <h3>Highlights of Nicolas Cage's Acting Career:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">1964</span> - Born in Long Beach, California as <i>Nicolas Kim Coppola</i>.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1980</span> - At the age of 16, dropped out of Beverly Hills High School to pursue an acting career.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1981</span> - Made his acting debut in the TV pilot <i>The Best of Times</i>, which was never picked up by ABC.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1982</span> - Made his film debut in <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, with a minor role as an unnamed co-worker of Judge Reinhold's character. After his role in this film, he adopted the stage name of Cage, because he wanted to assure himself that any success he had was based on his own merits, not the fame of his uncle, Francis Ford Coppola. His choice of name was inspired by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage and composer John Cage.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1983</span> - Had his first starring role, opposite Deborah Foreman, in <i>Valley Girl</i>, a romantic comedy loosely inspired by <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1987</span> - Earns his first Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor, starring, opposite Cher, in romantic comedy <i>Moonstruck</i>, a hit with both critics and audiences.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1995</span> - Coming out of a bit of a career slump, Cage wins the <span class="bold">Academy Award for Best Actor</span> and <span class="bold">Golden Globe Award for Best Actor</span> for his performance in <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>, portraying an alcoholic screenwriter who falls in love with a prostitute in Las Vegas. To prepare for the part, Cage binge drank for two weeks and studied footage of himself.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1996</span> - Stars, alongside Sean Connery and Ed Harris, in Michael Bay's <i>The Rock</i>, the first of many of action, franchise and blockbuster films that would bring him great financial success.</i></li>
                    <li><span class="bold">2018</span> - Facing significant financial difficulties, largely due to extravagant spending on real estate, art, and collectibles, Cage spent almost a decade working on unmemorable straight-to-video projects to pay his debt off. Coming out of his career setback, Cage starred in 2018's <i>Mandy</i>, a critical success that kickstarted his resurgence.</i></li>
                    <li><span class="bold">2025</span> - Cage has given multiple critically acclaimed performances since <i>Mandy</i>, cementing himself as one of the greats of his generation. Although he doesn't plan to give up acting entirely, he thinks that a transition into theater and/or television sounds likely.</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="end-quote">"In Cage's hands, cartoonish moments are imbued with real emotion and real emotions become cartoons. Everything - from individual scenes down to single lines of dialogue - feel like they have been embraced as opportunities for creation. Cage is usually interesting even when his films are not. He is erratic and unpredictable; he is captivating and he is capricious. He is a performer. He is a troubadour. He is a jazz musician."</p>
